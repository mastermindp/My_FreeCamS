## 🧠 How It Works

These scripts use Cheat Engine's **Auto Assembler (AA)** to inject custom assembly into the game's memory. We hook camera update functions and override position/rotation values manually.

Some scripts use **AOB scanning** for compatibility across game versions.

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Launch your game.
2. Open Cheat Engine.
3. Load one of the `.CT` scripts from this repo.
4. Attach CE to the game process.
5. Activate the script(s).
6. Use hotkeys or the CE interface to control the cam.
